<h1 align="center">KRIA ROS PERCEPTION APPLICATION</h1>

## Introduction
This repository contains the pre-built ROS perception example application. The ROS 2 Perception Node accelerated application implements a subset of image_pipeline, which is one of the most popular packages in the ROS 2 ecosystem and a core piece of the ROS perception stack. To get more details on this application please check the documentation [here](https://xilinx.github.io/kria-apps-docs/kr260/build/html/docs/ros2_perception_node/docs/introduction.html).
<br><br>
This application is based on [KRS](https://xilinx.github.io/KRS/sphinx/build/html/index.html)(Kria Robotics Framework) and it demonstrates the capabilities of KRS on how a roboticits can leverage programmable logic to accelerate their applications efficiently without having deeper hardware knowledge. This simple application is implemented to give users a quick hands on with KRS framework and get roboticists started to write their hardware accelerated applications on Kria Robotics starter kit easily.


## Hardware Requirement

- KR260 Robotics Starter Kit
- KR260 Power Supply & Adapter (Included with KR260 Robotics Starter Kit)
- Cat 5e Ethernet Cable (Included with KR260 Robotics Starter Kit)
- USB-A to micro-B Cable (Included with KR260 Robotics Starter Kit)
- 16GB MicroSD Cards (Included with KR260 Robotics Starter Kit)
- Ubuntu 22.04 workstation(x86 Host) with ethernet port for setting up simulation on Gazebo and Visualizing the simulated nodes on RQT


## Hardware Setup And Execution

Detailed steps on how you can setup your host environment, target board environment and how to deploy and execute this application, are very well explained in the documentation [here](https://xilinx.github.io/kria-apps-docs/kr260/build/html/docs/ros2_perception_node/docs/app_deployment.html). Please refer to [Perception app documentationhttps://xilinx.github.io/kria-apps-docs/kr260/build/html/docs/ros2_perception_node/ros2_perception_node_landing.html](https://xilinx.github.io/kria-apps-docs/kr260/build/html/docs/ros2_perception_node/ros2_perception_node_landing.html) page and try this application.
